### About me

I study *Biochemistry* in *Universidad de Chile*. For three years I've been doing research as part of the **Brain-Machine Interfaces laboratory** in Pontificia **Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile**. I'm also doing an internship in the **Laboratorio de Neurosistemas** about *Bistable perception* and cognition using neuroimgaing methods like EEG. I also like to write on my free time so you can find some of that here in my personal web-page. You can also find some of my personal projects here. Take a look!
